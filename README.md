### 🪑 Furniture Store

This project is a furniture store web application built with a REST API backend and a front-end client.

🔐 Register, login, and logout with authentication (hashed passwords & token-based sessions)

🪑 Browse all furniture in the catalog (guest or logged-in users)

➕ Create, edit, and delete furniture (only for the creator)

📄 View furniture details with conditional actions based on ownership

📂 See personal furniture listings under My Publications ( Coming Soon )

The app includes form validation, session handling, and dynamic navigation based on user state.

## 📌 Note

The **frontend client was provided by SoftUni** as part of the course materials.  
My task in this project was to **implement the backend (REST API)** that connects to the client, handles authentication, validation, and database operations.
